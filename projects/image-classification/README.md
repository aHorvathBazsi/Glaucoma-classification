# Ocumeda Machine Learning Coding Challenge

The task of this coding challenge is to develop a simple baseline approach for glaucoma classification on retinal fundus images.

## Goals

1. Implement a machine learning approach for classification of glaucoma on retinal fundus images. Your approach should make sense as a simple baseline method.
2. Evaluate your approach in a meaningful way that would allow a fair comparison to other methods. 
    * Define 1-3 meaningful metrics
    * Develop a meaningful experimental setup in terms of training/test/validation split and cross validation
3. Present your approach and key results (10 minutes max). Please keep in mind that the target audience has diverse educational backgrounds.

## Data

We are using the data from the [AIROGS Glaucoma Screening Challenge](https://airogs.grand-challenge.org). You can downnload the data from the challenge website. 


## Implementation

You should implement your approach in Python 3. For your ML approach, you can use libraries such as `torch`, `tensorflow`, `keras`, `scikit-learn`, `scikit-image`, `pandas`, `pytorch-lightning`. 
ðŸ’¡Hint: As a starting point, you might find the discussions from the [Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/code?competitionId=4104&sortBy=voteCount) useful.


## Next Steps and Interview
Please implement your approach in a private GitHub fork of this respository and send us the your code at least 12 hours before your 2nd interview. Please structure the repository such that we can reproduce a run (without data paths). For providing us the code, please send us a zip-export of the forked repo.
